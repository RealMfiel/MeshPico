Flexo Release Notes v1.1

Thank you for downloading Flexo, the flexible Meshtastic powered node case the supports multiple device boards! Check the intro video on my Youtube channel http://www.youtube.com/@zerofox3d

Before you print.... Flexo uses a custom PCB power switch which I had designed and manufactured by PCBway plus a few screws to secure the boards internally. You could build Flexo without the switch by wiring a battery straight to the board but I sell the PCB switch with the other hardware as a kit with worldwide shipping from my website zerofox3D.com. It's not expensive and much cheaper than buying one of my fully printed case kits.

So print the case and if you like it order a hardware kit!

**** Printing Notes ****

Printing Flexo is easy! Both STL and Prusa Slicer 3MF files are provided, I recommend using the latter as several files have custom support enforcers/blockers.

I recommend printing at standard 0.2 layer height, I always test in the "Quality" preset in Prusa Slicer and always print in PLA or PLA+. Note that printing in PETG may result in poor fitting as it has different tolerances. The friction clips that are used to assemble Flexo have fine tolerances so you need a well calibrated/modern printer. In files where support is needed always use Organic/Tree supports.

Flexo is broken down into several parts, you could combine them on to a single build plate but I recommend printing each separately as it reduces layer printing time which improves quality.

There are folders organising the files for simplicity. The "universal" folder contains files needed regardless of which board you are using, print them all except for the battery mounts, printing which ever you are using. There are then folders fro each board containing the appropriate "front" and depending on the board a bracket. Lastly there is a folder for the Smart Mount which doubles as a wall mount or GoPro mount.
